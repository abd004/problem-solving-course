There is two types of quries (its will give you an array and some questions ) : 
1-static like: no updates 
2-dynamic: there is update like(change a value of element at the array)

we will learn about static quries like: prefix sum 

prefix sum: 
ex: you have an array and in each qurie it will give you an left and right inerval to find the sum of elements in this interval
arr[10]={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
prefix sum array: pref[i]=pref[i-1]+arr[i]
pref[10]=[1,3,6,10,15,21,28,36,45,55]
find an sum for l=1 and r=9 = pref[8]
find an sum for l=3 r=8 = pref[7]-pref[1]
but its better to make the array refers to 0 index

there is prefix multiplication like : pref[i]=pref[i-1]*arr[i]
and if it give you l=3 , r=8:-->  pref[8]/pref[2]

or prefix xor : pref[i]=pref[i-1]^arr[i]  xor doesnot have an opposite 
and if it give you l=3 , r=8:-->  pref[8]^pref[2]

or prefix and: pref[i]=pref[i-1]&arr[i] the opposite of and(&) is or and the opposite is true
and if it give you l=3 , r=8:-->  pref[8] | pref[2]
